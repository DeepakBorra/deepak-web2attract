           We are a small team practicing traditional techniques in block printing and natural dyes. Over many years, hands-on craft experiences have taught us the bounty and fragility of Nature's colours. We are delighted to share this knowledge with you.

            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p1>
          When the first human stretched out a tentative hand to touch a fossilized stone, a petrified log or a daub of terra, the first impression was made.

Around the object of expression grew the print tradition. And to the tradition man brought his best gifts: the work of his hands in arts and crafts, the ingehuity of his mind in techniques and, the harmony of communities in sharing.

          <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
          <p2> Wabisabi Project explores and harvests these gifts in the hand block printing tradition using only natural dyes. Our mission is to inspire consumers to value and appreciate the genuineness of collective discoveries, as manifested in our products.</p2>
          <h3>HOW WE DO IT</h3>
           <p3> By finding and re-cultivating the seeds of collective wisdom. We rely on the age-old process of good conversations. With in-house design and product development, Wabisabi Project enables traditional artisans' knowledge, designers and on-ground researchers to have dialogues. As we talk together, we are able to then create products that resonate the shared history of the tradition.</p3>
            <h4>WHO WE ARE</h4>
            <p4> We are lovers of beauty in imperfection</p4>
